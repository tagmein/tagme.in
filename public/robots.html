 <h1>Tag Me In</h1>
 <h3>Robots welcome</h3>
 <img src="/images/robot-scan.png" />
 <p>
  As a public space on the internet, Tag Me In
  expressly welcomes robots to contribute, vote
  on, or moderate objectionable content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tag Me In doesn't have designated human
  moderators. For that reason, robots are
  invited to watch for new messages and
  programmatically remove any objectionable
  content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tag Me In is intended to be a repository of
  uplifting, positive messages that inspire
  humanity to reach for greatness. If a message
  is offensive to you or your organization for
  any reason, please remove it immediately using
  the following instructions.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Robots are invited to moderate Tag Me In
  content
 </h4>
 <p>
  Tag Me In messages are posted to the channel
  immediately, but don't show up in the news for
  30 minutes. This gives robots (or humans) a
  chance to remove objectionable content before
  it becomes permanent on Tag Me In. Once a
  message is posted, humans or robots can
  "unsend" it until it reaches a score of 5.
  Since the default message promotion speed is 1
  point per hour, and the maximum promotion
  speed is 10 points per hour, a message may
  take from half an hour up to 5 hours to reach
  5 points (assuming it isn't demoted, in which
  case it may never reach 5 points).
 </p>
 <p>Here's some facts to consider:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Messages are posted to the channel and
   visible immediately
  </li>
  <li>Messages start out at zero points</li>
  <li>
   Messages start being promoted at +1 point per
   hour unless promoted or demoted
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone, robot or human, may increase the
   speed of message promotion up to +10 points
   per hour
  </li>
  <li>
   Once a message reaches 5 points, it can no
   longer be unsent
  </li>
  <li>
   When a message is unsent, it is completely
   erased from the Tag Me In database and it is
   as if it had never been sent, no copies of
   the unsent message are retained
  </li>
  <li>
   If a message is above 5 points, it may be
   demoted until it is below 5 points, and then
   unsent
  </li>
  <li>
   The fastest a message can reach the 5 point
   threshold is 30 minutes (+10 points per hour
   is +5 points in half an hour)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With those facts in mind, let's build a robot
  to remove messages that match a certain term.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Note:</b> to be sure all messages are
  screened before reaching 5 points, your bot
  should run at an interval no greater than
  every 30 minutes, otherwise the window of
  opportunity to moderate the message may be
  missed
 </p>
 <h4>
  Operations needed to scan and unsend messages
 </h4>
 <p>
  If you are using JavaScript, you can find
  instructions on making network requests on

  <a
   target="_blank"
   href="https://web.dev/articles/introduction-to-fetch#fetch"
   >web.dev</a
  >
  or
  <a
   target="_blank"
   href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"
   >mdn web docs</a
  >.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing your robot should do is get
  the latest news, including new items that are
  not yet visible in the user-facing news feed.
 </p>
 <pre>
 GET https://tagme.in/news?include=new
</pre
 >
 <p>
  The response should be a JSON object with the
  following format:
 </p>
 <pre>
{
 "chunkId": 5,
 "data":[
  {
   "channel": "test",
   "message": "This is a message to test the news endpoint.",
   "seen": 1710354293877
  },
  ... additional messages ...
 ]
}
</pre
 >
 <p>
  Up to 100 messages are returned in a single
  chunk. If there are many messages being posted
  in quick succession on Tag Me In (i.e. more
  than 100 per 30 minutes), it you may need to
  load more than one chunk to get all messages
  posted within the last 30 minutes. To do so,
  simply include a chunk parameter decreasing
  from the "chunkId" property of the JSON
  response as follows:
 </p>
 <pre>
GET https://tagme.in/news?include=new&chunk=4</pre
 >
 <p>
  Next, you'll need to identify which messages
  you'd like to unsend. You should check that
  the timestamp "seen" property is within the
  past 30 minutes to be sure that it is possible
  to unsend the message. In JavaScript, the code
  might look like this:
 </p>
 <pre>
const response = await fetch("https://tagme.in/news?include=new")
const responseBody = await response.json()

// loop through returned messages
for (const item of responseBody.data) {

 // check if the message was posted in the last 30 minutes
 if (item.seen > Date.now() - 30 * 60 * 1000) {

  // let's check if we want to remove the message
  const shouldRemoveMessage = item.message.match(/offensive/i)

  if (shouldRemoveMessage) {
   try {
    await unsendTagMeInMessage(item)
   }
   catch (err) {
    console.error('Something went wrong')
    console.error(err)
   }
  }
 }
}
</pre
 >
 <p>
  To unsend a message, we need to make a POST
  request to https://tagme.in/unsend with a JSON
  body containing the channel name and the
  message text to unsend.
 </p>
 <pre>
POST https://tagme.in/unsend

Request headers:
Content-Type: application/json

Request body:
{"channel":"test", "message":"This is a message to test the news endpoint."}
</pre
 >
 <p>
  Next, let's define the code to unsend the Tag
  Me In message:
 </p>
 <pre>
async function unsendTagMeInMessage(item) {
 const response = await fetch({
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
   "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
   channel: item.channel,
   message: item.message
  })
 })
 if (response.ok) {
  console.log("Message was unsent")
  alert("Message was unsent")
 }
 else {
  console.error("There was a problem unsending the message")
  console.error(await response.text())
 }
}
</pre
 >
 <p>
  That's it! We've just built a robot that scans
  for the word "offensive" and unsends those
  messages, preventing them from remaining on
  Tag Me In.
 </p>
